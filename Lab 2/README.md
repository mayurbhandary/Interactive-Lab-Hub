# Interactive Prototyping: The Clock of Pi

## Part E.
### Modify the barebones clock to make it your own


\*\*\***A copy of your code should be in your Lab 2 Github repo.**\*\*\*
The code for my modified clock can be found in meme_clock.py. I made a clock that displyas the hour in the form of a meme. Each meme represents an hour of the day. You can reprogram the ordering of the memes by pressing the top button and you can cheat to see what the hour is by pressing the bottom button. I added the latter feature so that users can learn which hour each meme corresponds to. 


## Part F. 
## Make a short video of your modified barebones PiClock

\*\*\***Take a video of your PiClock.**\*\*\*
Here is the video [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uET-HvDx4ghBFBYqeX8aqr4EhjqSRc3t/view?usp=sharing)


## Part G. 
## Sketch and brainstorm further interactions and features you would like for your clock for Part 2.

It would be good to show intermediate times instead of just the hour. I could do this by having the memes scrol instead of just having a static image. The user would know what time it is based on the relative space that the meme occupies on the screen. 

Here's a link to a sketch board of further interaction [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N9YyW0fWrmnGxjX_1b4EfSkK9i0AjRMe/view?usp=sharing)

# Prep for Part 2

1. Pick up remaining parts for kit.

2. Look at and give feedback on the Part G. for at least 2 other people in the class (and get 2 people to comment on your Part G!)

# Lab 2 Part 2

Pull Interactive Lab Hub updates to your repo.

Modify the code from last week's lab to make a new visual interface for your new clock. You may [extend the Pi](Extending%20the%20Pi.md) by adding sensors or buttons, but this is not required.

As always, make sure you document contributions and ideas from others explicitly in your writeup.

You are permitted (but not required) to work in groups and share a turn in; you are expected to make equal contribution on any group work you do, and N people's group project should look like N times the work of a single person's lab. What each person did should be explicitly documented. Make sure the page for the group turn in is linked to your Interactive Lab Hub page.
