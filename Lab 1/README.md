# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 
<!--
To stage the interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.
-->
<!--
\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
-->
**Context:** We wanted to make a device that allows users to wake up naturally through light instead of sound. The light should be programmable to emulate the setting of their choice. For example, if the user is in a gloomy city like Seattle, they could use the device to emulate the experience of waking up to a sunny day. 

**Setting:** This interaction happens in a bedroom that is completely pitch black. The curtains must be sufficiently opaque so that light from outside does not interfere with the light produced by the device. The interaction takes place at night while programming the device and in the morning while waking up to the device's light. 

**Players:** The only person involved in this interaction is the person who sleeps in the bedroom (assuming they are sleeping alone). This individual is a health-conscious person who wants to keep their cortisol levels low by avoiding an intrusive wakeup call from a traditional alarm.

**Activity:** The actor simply sets the time of day and color setting for the alarm and goes to sleep. At their desired wake up time, the sunlight alarm must be sufficiently bright enough to wake them gently from their sleep. 

**Goals:** The user's goal is to wake up on time using only light. The light should ideally grow into existence so as to not create the jarring effect of abruptly opening the blinds. 


**Sketch a storyboard of the interactions you are planning. It does not need to be perfect, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene.**

Here are the storyboards that we came up with during our planning session:

Present your idea to the other people in your breakout room. You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

Initially we were going to use one bright light source to wake up the user but realized this could be just as jarring as an alarm clock. Isntead we decided to use various colors to soften the wake up process. One point of conversation was how the user programs the device to set the color. We decided to keep the interface simple by only providing three color options. 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

<!--
Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 
-->

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

When we first acted the scene out it seemed difficult for the user to program a color for the device. Instead of having a complicated interface to program the device, we opted for 3 simple buttons. We also ran into the issue of the light source not being strong enough and realized that the light source would need to be at least as powerful as a lamp for this idea to be effective.  

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

We need a stronger light source to ensure that the user is able to wake up with light alone. A small light wouldn't be sufficiently bright enough to fill the room with light and wake up the user.

We also discussed the possibility of using the light to also convey the outside temperature by flashing at different frequencies once the wake up phase is complete. For example, if the temperature is high outside, the light would pulse faster than if it were cold outside. Alternatively, we could use a secondary color as a mechanism to convey outside temperature as well. The user could customize the settings to trigger the feature at their desired temperature thresholds. 


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*
I ran into issues installing packages for tinkerbell. For some reason pip installing the requirements would get stuck on my machine so we ended up using someone elses. 

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*
Initally, we tried using a projector as a way to simulate additional light given off by the device. We blocked off ambient light from the window with bedsheets. 

Here's us setting up our first attempt:

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*
We changed the setup of our video by using the real ambient light from outside to mock a brighter light source for the device. 

## Part E. Costume the device


\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
We designed this device with simplicity in mind. There are 3 preset light settings on the top of the device to program what type of light the user will wake up to. The user can select from cool, amber, and neutral lighting profiles. The device should sit near the bed so it must be small enough to fit on a stand. It must be large enough to house powerful light source and throw it in the direction that the user desires. 

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
I worked with Alex Kluver abk98, Lauren Tran lat89, and Magdalena Horowitz myh26 on this project. All of us contributed equally to the planing, design and filming of this project.
